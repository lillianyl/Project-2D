# Project-2D
A bioinformatics research project (UCSD BIMM 143) investigating the differences between caffeine synthases from tea vs coffee

Contains Project 2 in two file formats (html, ipynb), a fasta file with protein sequences for 4 caffeine synthases, and 2 PDB files containing structure information for TCS1A and DXMT2

## Scientific Question: Why do tea leaves (Camellia sinensis) have a different caffeine content than the same amount of coffee beans (Coffea arabica)?

## Scientific Hypothesis: If caffeine synthases, such as TCS1 and CaDXMT1/CaDXMT2, are known to be essential to the caffeine synthesis pathway and known to have similar expression levels in Camellia sinensis and Coffea arabica, respectively, then it is likely that the difference in caffeine content between the two species comes from differences in the enzyme structures.

    "Caffeine is a methylxanthine alkaloid found in a variety of plants, most notably Camellia sinensis (tea) and Coffea arabica (coffee), and is favored by many due to its stimulant nature. Caffeine inhibits adenosine-mediated downregulation of CNS activity and promotes neurotransmitter release that further stimulates the CNS (https://ncithesaurus.nci.nih.gov/ncitbrowser/ConceptReport.jsp?dictionary=NCI_Thesaurus&ns=ncit&code=C328). Caffeine biosynthesis in both tea and coffee plants mainly follows this pathway: xanthosine → 7-methylxanthosine → 7-methylxanthine → theobromine → caffeine (https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Caffeine-biosynthetic-pathway-in-tea-plants-showing-the-genes-studied-in-this-work-IMP_fig1_5323113#:~:text=The%20main%20biosynthetic%20pathway%20is,slow%20in%20caffeine%2Daccumulating%20plants). The enzymes involved in the synthesis of caffeine are N-methyltransferases, which transfer methyl groups from S-adenosyl-L-methionine onto caffeine precursors (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1165278/pdf/biochemj00564-0092.pdf). In tea plants, tea caffeine synthase 1 (TCS1) catalyzes the final two steps of caffeine synthesis, converting 7-methylxanthine to thebromine and theobromine to caffeine. In coffee plants, the final two steps of caffeine synthesis are catalyzed by CaMXMT and CaDXMT1, respectively (https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1602575113). CaDXMT2 has been studied relatively recently and is thought to catalyze the last two steps of caffeine synthesis, just as TCS1 does.\n",
    "\n",
    "The protein sequences and structures for TCS1 and CaDXMT can be found on the UniProt database (https://www.uniprot.org/). As stated on this database's website: \n",
    "\n",
    "\"The Universal Protein Resource (UniProt) is a comprehensive resource for protein sequence and annotation data. The UniProt databases are the UniProt Knowledgebase (UniProtKB), the UniProt Reference Clusters (UniRef), and the UniProt Archive (UniParc). The UniProt consortium and host institutions EMBL-EBI, SIB and PIR are committed to the long-term preservation of the UniProt databases. \n",
    "\n",
    "UniProt is a collaboration between the European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI), the SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics and the Protein Information Resource (PIR). Across the three institutes more than 100 people are involved through different tasks such as database curation, software development and support.\n",
    "\n",
    "EMBL-EBI and SIB together used to produce Swiss-Prot and TrEMBL, while PIR produced the Protein Sequence Database (PIR-PSD). These two data sets coexisted with different protein sequence coverage and annotation priorities. TrEMBL (Translated EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Data Library) was originally created because sequence data was being generated at a pace that exceeded Swiss-Prot's ability to keep up. Meanwhile, PIR maintained the PIR-PSD and related databases, including iProClass, a database of protein sequences and curated families. In 2002 the three institutes decided to pool their resources and expertise and formed the UniProt consortium.\""

    "numpy: NumPy stands for Numerical Python. It is a Python library used for working with arrays, which can be processed 50x faster than default Python lists. Numpy arrays are fater than lists because they are stored at one continuous place in memory using references. Arrays are very useful in data science, where speed and resources are two very important factors to consider. NumPy also has functions for linear algebra, fourier transform, and matrices. (https://www.w3schools.com/python/numpy/numpy_intro.asp) \n",
    "\n",
    "matplotlib: Matplotlib is a library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. Most of the Matplotlib utilites are in the pyplot submodule. With this package, many different types of visualizations, such as line plots, scatter plots, and histograms. Titles, axes, colors, sizes, and other aspects of a visual can be altered with Matplotlib. Figures created with Matplotlib are also interactive in that they can be resized, zoomed in/out on, and updated. (https://matplotlib.org/)\n",
    "\n",
    "nglview: NGLview is an IPython/Jupyter widget that allows for interactive visualizations of molecular structures and trajectories. This is especially useful for visualizing the 3D strucutres of proteins and other biological molecules. NGLview can read structures/trajectories from a variety of different file formats such as RCSB, PDB, and simpletraj. This project used PDB files. NGLview utilises the embeddable NGL Viewer for rendering its images. NGLView can also be used to alter the properties of the visualization (color, size, form of structure, etc.). (https://github.com/nglviewer/nglview)\n",
    "\n",
    "biopython: Biopython is a set of freely available tools for biological computation. The source code is available under the Biopython License, which is compatible with almost every license in the world. Biopython can be used for computational biology and bioinformatics and is designed to reduce code duplication. It contains classes to represent biological sequences and is able to read a variety of file formats. For example, fasta files from databases like NCBI or UniProt. Biopython has modules to perform sequence alignment, structural bioinformatics, population genetics, phylogenetics, etc. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopython) \n",

    "itertools: Itertools is a Python module that is used to iterate over data structures that can be stepped over using a for-loop. These data structures are called iterables. Itertools is fast and memory-efficient in addition to enhancing code readability. With Itertools, lists can be flattened, combinations can be found, permutations can be performed, etc. Itertools uses \"iterator algebra\"and can work with Iterator objects.

    "The plot above shows the similarities between protein sequences of, in order, TCS1A, DXMT1, TCS1E, and DXMT2. All four enzymes were downloaded from the UniProt. Caffeine synthases that are more similar to one another have a higher pairwise alignment score (closer to 380 & yellow) and those that are less similar to one another have a lower pairwise alignment score (closer to 200 & purple). Each cell in the matrix represents a pairwise alignment score score. The central diagonal all yellow because these are comparing the similarity between a compound and itself. The two TCS1 enzymes (TCS1A and TCS1E) have a high similarity with a pairwise alignment score of around 360. The two CaDXMT enzymes (DXMT1 and DXMT2) have a slightly lower sequence similarity with a pairwise alignment score of around 340. However, pairs of enzymes between species (i.e. TCS1A and DXMT1 or 2) have very low pairwise alignment scores, around 200, indicating around 50% difference between these sequences (200 similarities out of about 400 amino acids total)."

    "If we look at the structure of the two caffeine synthases above (TCS1A and DXMT2), the lack of similarity seen in the heat map makes sense in that caffeine synthases from Camellia sinensis are very different from caffeine synthases from Coffea arabica. Not only are the protein sequences different, but so are the protein structures. The folding and conformations of TCS1A and DXMT2 are quite different. This can be seen not only from the nglview visualizations but also from the different distances between the first and second instances of GLY, PRO, and CYS. While all amino acids in a protein sequence contribute to a protein folding and structure, PRO and CYS are especially pertinent as PRO is bulky and disrupts alpha-helices and CYS builds disulfide bridges. Since the distances are different, the folding will be different. Thus, assuming that expression levels of these two enzymes are similar in their respective plants and that they both play the same role in the caffeine biosynthesis pathway (catalyzing the final two steps), then my hypothesis is likely to be correct and the difference in caffeine content between Camellia sinensis and Coffea arabica is due to strucutral differences of their caffeine synthases."
